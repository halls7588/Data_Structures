# Data_Structures
A general list of Data Structures implemented in many different programming languages.
This project is intended to help newer developers, code school graduates, and self-taught developers learn and grasp the basic concepts of Data Structures to help build a foundation of basic engineering concepts and algorithm design in whatever language they feel most comfortable with. 

## Getting Started

Download or clone the Repo, Load your IDE of choice, Pick your language and pick youâ€™re Data Structure, and the code should be ready to use. Please not that this code has been tested and it may require some minor changes to work. 

### Prerequisites

Depending on the language you wish to use, you will need a compatible IDE capable of running the type of code you are using. Place note these were not built to be projects but rather to be added to your own project. In example:

```
To use the C# Binary Tree, clone the tree and place it into your Visual Studio Project
To Use the Java Linked List, clone the List and place it into you IntelliJ project
ect. ect. 
```
## Deployment

Please note, this code was intended to help newer developers to grasp the concepts of various Data Structures. None of this code has been tested and may need modification to work properly.
